# ETL_Movies

## Summary
 
the aim of this project is to hel Britta to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. I create a code to create that takes datas from Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
