# ETL_Movies

The aim of this project is to help Britta to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. I have created a code that takes files from Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens data and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
